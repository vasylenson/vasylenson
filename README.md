### Hi, I'm Marko :wave:

I'm a student, web-developer, and a programming enjoyer.

- :mortar_board: study Computer Science at [University of Twente](https://github.com/utwente)
- :book: also learning a bunch of maths, web, dev-ops, and other stuff
- :star_struck: love exploring programming language design, distributed systems, and computer simulations
- :building_construction: currently building [bit-vm](https://github.com/vasylenson/bit-vm), a toy virtual machine
